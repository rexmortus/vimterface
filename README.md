# Vimterface

Vimterface is a vim-like user interface for web applications, written in Javascript.

It is inspired by projects like [vimperator](http://www.vimperator.org/) which add vim-like functionality to applications that are not text editors.

The notion is simple. Vimterface adds a UI component into the DOM and allows you to bind keystrokes to user-defined functions. It also has a command mode.
